## Gestreino v2.0

#### About

Many gyms, health clubs, and sports clubs operate without objective and effective monitoring of their clients'/athletes' condition. Consequently, the common goal—improving performance without the onset of injuries and chronic fatigue—is not always achieved, hindering client loyalty and increasing costs for equipment, instructors/coaches, and more.

GESTREINO emerges as an indispensable application for the operationalization of the training process, scientifically compiling all the knowledge on training methodology and its organizational aspects, from the presentation of a set of tests that allow for standardized assessment to the effective prescription of a training program.
